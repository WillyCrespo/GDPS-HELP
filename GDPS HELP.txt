--------------#GDPS HELP#------------------
This is for the APK so you can get your GDPS on android:
Help with replacing libcocos2dapp (HxD: www.boomlings.com to d2lsbHkwMTIudWV1by5jb20= )
Change AndroidManifest.xml (inside: com.robtopx.geometryjump to com.willy012.geometrydash )

On PC it's the same except you hex edit GeometryDash.exe HxD: www.boomlings.com to yourGdpsLink and also you have to change the base64 value translate www.boomlings.com to base64 and replace that by your GDPS link in base64.
Make sure your GDPS link is the same lenght as either; www.boomlings.com or www.boomlings.com/database
